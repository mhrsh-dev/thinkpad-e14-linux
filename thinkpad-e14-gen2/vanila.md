### Known issues

- [Enable Trackpoint & Buttons](../tweaks/trackpoint/README.md) : In case you cannot use the trackpoint and its respective buttons, we recommend you to read this small guide to enable them. This problem should be solved in kernel versions after 5.10.
- [Intel CPU Throttling](../tweaks/intel-cpu-throttling/README.md) : Performance issues? Check this guide in order to get a better experience with Intel CPUs. Also checkout TLP in order to extend your battery life.
- [Speakers issues in Second Gen](../tweaks/audio/README.md): In case you cannot access the microphone or the device has no audio output. An atypical problem that we still have no way of detecting in advance.
